# Choice
- reading the source code maybe a good idea.
1. there are three entities. one teammate(oracle) and two teams(k2 and other).
2. oracle is making the decision to choose one from two teams.
3. there is little time left, you stand on k2, and you can help him. 
- and you can also run this little app in jdk 1.8+(Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA maybe a good choice).
1. try to send priority value with a http client(restclient[firefox] or postman[chrome]), using PUT method and 'http://localhost:9495?priority=${PRIORITY_VALUE}' url, make something change.
2. priority value must between 1(min) and 10(max).
3. you can kill current process for rerunning.
- have fun and take it easy.
