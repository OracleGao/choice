# Choice
- reading the source code maybe a good idea.
* there are three entities. one teammate(oracle) and two teams(k2 and other).
* oracle is making the decision to choose one from two teams.
* you are the k2 leader, and you can help him. 
- and you can also run this little app in jdk 1.8+.
* try to send priority value with a http client(restclient[firefox] or postman[chrome]), using PUT method and 'http://localhost:9495?priority=${PRIORITY_VALUE}' url, make something change.
* priority value must between 1(min) and 10(max).
* you can kill current process for rerunning.
- have fun and take it easy.
